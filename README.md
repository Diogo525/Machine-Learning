# Machine Learning
## Introduction 

In recent years Machine Learning has become very popular in various fields of research such as Medicine, Computer Science and Physics.

While studying for the Machine Learning course at university, I'm compiling information about the various algorithms studied and the respective implementations and simulations.

The course I'm taking follows almost the same structure as the Coursera Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng, which is also one of my sources of information.

## Techniques

The Machine Learning techniques that are going to be covered are:

### Supervised Learning

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Neural Networks
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Decision Trees

### Unsupervised Learning

- [ ] K-means clustering
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- [ ] Naive Bayes (NB) classifier

## Tools

To develop the various algorithms in Python, the following libraries were used:

- Pandas: for importing data from CSV files
- Numpy: for math calculations
- matplotlib: for displaying the plots
