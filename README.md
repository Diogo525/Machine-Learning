# Machine Learning
## Introduction 

With the rapid evolution of computer hardware, Machine Learning has become very popular in various research fields such as Medicine, Computer Science and Physics, and is starting to become a standard in alot of industries worldwide.

While studying for the Machine Learning course at university, I decided to compile what I learned about the various algorithms studied, and the respective implementations and simulations, in this repo.

The course I'm taking follows a similar structure as the Machine Learning course taught by Andrew Ng at Coursera, which is also one of my sources of information.

## Techniques

The Machine Learning techniques that are going to be covered are:

### Supervised Learning

- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Neural Networks
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Decision Trees

### Unsupervised Learning

- [ ] K-means clustering
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- [ ] Naive Bayes (NB) classifier

## Tools

To develop the various algorithms in Python, the following libraries were used:

- Pandas: for importing data from CSV files
- Numpy: for math calculations
- matplotlib: for displaying the plots
